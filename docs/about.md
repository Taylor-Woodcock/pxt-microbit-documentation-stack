## Energy in Schools Learning Environment

Welcome to Energy in Schools, an interactive learning environment which aims to change behaviour towards energy consumption through learning about energy, using data collected in your school through Samsung Smart Things Hub and even design and build energy saving devices using the micro:bit.

These materials have been designed so that children can; 

* Learn about Energy, including energy generation, the impact on climate change and energy use in school and home


* Learn how to programme micro:bits to learn about the school environment


* Read and act on data collected from the Samsung Smart Things System


* Explore energy information from your micro:bits. Link it with national energy data. Share and compare with other schools.


* Make your energy info visual on a model/posters: school hot spots & cold corners, energy use now & then


* Generate ideas, design and carry out projects which will enable pupils to be proactive in managing their schools energy use


As well as practical Energy in Schools projects using the micro:bit and Makecode editor, we have provided teaching materials  based on Energy and Internet of Things. We also provide hints and tips so that your school Energy Champions can develop their own energy saving projects for the school.
